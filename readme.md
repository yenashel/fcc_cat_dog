Sources from where I re-used code snippets or looked up the documentation are contained in the comments of the source code.

When I got stuck creating the test data flow (the thing with the PATH variable) and on compiling the model (I got an error/warning when using softmax first in the activation function of the output layer) I found some solutions in the internet, e.g. from https://medium.com/@varunchindage/cat-and-dog-image-classifier-c820c27432c

In contrast to the above linked source I was however just reaching 66% accuracy, probably as in #5 I am using different random transformations and on top my model looks slightly different.

I assume that a larger model, e.g. twice the size on filters, would improve my results, but as I have a 7 year old machine I was not keen on creating too many trainable parameters.
